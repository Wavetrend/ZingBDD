# About

ZingBDD is a minimal BDD framework for C++ inspired by [RSpec](http://rspec.info).

## Features

* Simple code constructs to keep your specs (tests) clean and easy to read.
* Type specific matchers so you can only apply appropriate expectations on your test objects.

Please note: This is an early alpha version.  I'd encourage you to give it a try and provide feedback on problems that you encounter.  Use Github Issues to report problems, feedback and ask questions.

## Requirements

1. You'll need a C++11 compliant compiler to use ZingBDD, as it uses language constructs only available there.
2. There is an Xcode 5 project included that builds the demos.
